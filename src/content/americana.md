Platinum winner of "Best Restaurant" by CommunityVotes Bend in 2023, as well as "Best Burger in 2022 and 2023 and "Best Fries" in 2023. Plus 2nd place in "Best Food Cart" in SourceWeekly in 2023. Not bad for Joe Franco's cart that's just a few years old.

The fries are McDonald's style, which is smart. I think the basic OG is a masterpeice, your best smashburger bet in town. But I also find all the specials and variations a bit much, as in they tend to pile things on and go big rather than just deviate style or flavor.

From [Janay Wright's review](https://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/enjoy-a-smash-burger-for-8-at-the-americana-food-truck-in-bend/article_8730e4a4-91ca-11ed-a896-672585f7e686.html):

> While most smash burgers are cooked by continually smashing and flipping the burger, The Americana allows the burger to cook in place on the grill, forming a crust on the bottom.

> The two patties flared beyond the bun on all sides like a skirt, dotted with melted cheese. The additional crispiness formed by allowing the patty to sizzle in place on the grill was visible.
