The OG is perfect. The best smashburger in Bend. Soft bun, crispy shredded lettuce, and all the flavor you'd want. Their specials veer toward "too much", but it's hard to blame them, best to keep things interesting.

The staff is friendly and clearly passionate.

The fries are McDonalds clones and plentiful which I find perfect.
