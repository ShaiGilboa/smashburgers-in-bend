From [Janay Wright's review](https://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/entertainment/blue-eyes-burgers-and-fries-in-bend-offers-classic-diner-experience/article_5b32a9f0-06e7-11ed-9f65-9f324b0fdbf7.html):

> The smash burgers are prepared on a Jacksonâ€™s Corner griddled sweet bun with thinly shaved onions smashed directly into the patty itself. True to the smash burger style, the hamburger is thin, asymmetrical and crispy.

As a full-blown shop, they can and do offer more, a kid's burger, onion rings, soft-serve based deserts, and even a full bar.
