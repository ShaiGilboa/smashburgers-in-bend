It ain't just dogs.

[Nancy](https://eatdrinkbend.com/smash-burgers-bend-oregon/):

> Don’t let the name fool you—Alley Dogz now serves smash burgers alongside their extensive hot dog and corn dog offerings. This smashy comes with a heaping of grilled onions, pickles, and gooey American cheese.

I haven't actually tried one yet so it's on my list to go check out. I'm a fan of the Yacht Club anyway — almost every single cart there is very good.
