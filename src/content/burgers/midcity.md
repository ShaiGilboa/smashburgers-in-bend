[Their website](https://midcitysmashedburger.com/about-1):

> Prepared with 80/20 Oregon beef sourced from Painted Hills, our classic Smashy Boi is smashed flat beneath a cast-iron press, resulting in thin and crispy patties. Our burgers are covered in American cheese, and Smash Sauce, and served up on Franz Bakery buns, for an accessible for all $6 price tag.

That's an inexpensive burger! The Americana truck has an [explicit goal of affordability](https://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/enjoy-a-smash-burger-for-8-at-the-americana-food-truck-in-bend/article_8730e4a4-91ca-11ed-a896-672585f7e686.html) but clocks in at $8 to MidCity's $6.

In 2021, MidCity was named <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/dining/2021/03/portlands-14-best-smash-burgers-reviewed-and-ranked.html">Portlandâ€™s best smash burger</a> by The Oregonian, so let's hope that quality makes it way to Bend's cart!
