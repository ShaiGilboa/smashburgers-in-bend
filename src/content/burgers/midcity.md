> Prepared with 80/20 Oregon beef sourced from Painted Hills, our classic Smashy Boi is smashed flat beneath a cast-iron press, resulting in thin and crispy patties. Our burgers are covered in American cheese, and Smash Sauce, and served up on Franz Bakery buns, for an accessible for all $6 price tag.
