Chris and Kahla's dedication to perfectly classic smashburgers is unmatched with Willieburger. From [Eat Drink Bend's profile page](https://eatdrinkbend.com/restaurants/willieburger/):

> We’re a mom and pop burger cart that keeps it simple. We specialize in smash style burgers that come standard with grilled onions, cheese, and burger sauce. Our options are singles, doubles, and triples. All burgers come with a bag of chips.

Entirely based on taste, they are my favorite. But frankly the unpredictable hours and location have left me frustrated a few times and I'm a creature that values predictability. Willieburger is brand new though, only opening in 2022, and I'd say _most_ carts took longer than that to find their footing. The fact that they sell out at every event is a good sign.
