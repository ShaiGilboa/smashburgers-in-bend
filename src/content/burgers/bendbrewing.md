I think this Bend Brewing Company smashburger _just_ squeaks in as being worthy of the name smashburger. It's pretttttty thick as far as the genre is concerned. No thin crispy edges to be found. But it honors the genre generally with just the grilled onions, american cheese, and basic lettuce, and I'll admit it was perfectly tasty.
